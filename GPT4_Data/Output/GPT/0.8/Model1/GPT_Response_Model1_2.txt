Given the user story, the following intentional elements can be identified:

- 'Actors': 
    - Traffic Simulator system
    - Traffic engineers and designers who are the stakeholders in this system.

- 'SoftGoals': 
    - Efficient road traffic engineering and design 
    - Quick aid in development via clear visualizations 
    - Highlighting congestion through density maps 
    - Demonstrating traffic flow and bottlenecks through animations 
    - These soft goals imply requirements such as responsiveness, accuracy, and user-friendliness of the system.

    - Enable traffic flow simulation 
    - Deliver the most efficient road traffic engineering and design.

- 'Tasks': 
    - Simulation of traffic flow 
    - Creation and delivery of clear visualizations 
    - Development and display of density maps 
    - Animation of traffic flow and bottlenecks.

- 'Resources':
    - Traffic data for simulation and modelling 
    - Tools for creating clear visualizations, density maps, and animations.

- 'Contribution links': 
    - The creation of clear visualizations contributes to the goal of quick aid in development.
    - The creation of density maps contributes to the soft goal of highlighting congestion.
    - The animation of traffic flow and bottlenecks contributes to the soft goal of demonstrating traffic flow.

- 'Dependencies links': 
    - The task of creating clear visualizations depends on the availability of traffic data.
    - The task of simulating traffic flow depends on the availability of tools for creating visualizations, density maps, and animations.

- 'Decomposition links':
    - The goal of enabling traffic flow simulation is decomposed into tasks like simulation of traffic flow, creation of clear visualizations, and demonstration of traffic flow.
