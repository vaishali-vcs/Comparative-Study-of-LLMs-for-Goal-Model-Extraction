Great! Let's start by analyzing the first user story, s1: "As a user, I want to be able to view a map display of the public recycling bins around my area."

Actors:

* User (representing the stakeholder who wants to view the recycling bins on the map)

SoftGoals:

* Provide users with easy access to information about recycling bins in their area
* Enable users to plan their waste disposal routes more effectively
* Improve the user experience by providing a visual representation of recycling bins

Goals:

* Display the locations of public recycling bins on a map
* Allow users to search for recycling bins by location or type of waste accepted
* Offer information about the distance and directions to each recycling bin

Tasks:

* Create a map display of public recycling bins in the user's area
* Integrate a search function to allow users to find recycling bins by location or waste type
* Provide information about the distance and directions to each recycling bin

Resources:

* A map display of public recycling bins in the user's area
* A search function to allow users to find recycling bins by location or waste type
* Information about the distance and directions to each recycling bin

Contribution Links:

* The map display of public recycling bins will contribute to the soft goal of providing users with easy access to information about recycling bins in their area.
* The search function will contribute to the soft goal of enabling users to plan their waste disposal routes more effectively.
* The information about the distance and directions to each recycling bin will contribute to the soft goal of improving the user experience by providing a visual representation of recycling bins.

Dependencies Links:

* The map display of public recycling bins will depend on the availability of accurate location data for the recycling bins.
* The search function will depend on the availability of a database or API that provides information about the recycling bins.

Decomposition Links:

* The map display of public recycling bins can be decomposed into the following sub-elements:
	+ A map display of the user's current location
	+ A list of public recycling bins in the user's area
	+ A search function to allow users to find recycling bins by location or waste type
* The search function can be decomposed into the following sub-elements:
	+ A database or API that provides information about the recycling bins
	+ A search interface that allows users to enter their location or waste type
	+ A results list that displays the relevant recycling bins

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to analyze the other user stories.
