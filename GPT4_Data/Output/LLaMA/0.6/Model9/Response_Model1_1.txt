Note: In this example, the softgoals are not quantifiable, but they are still important for the success of the online counseling services. The goals are quantifiable and provide a clear measure of success. The tasks are the specific actions that need to be taken to achieve the goals and softgoals. The resources are the items that are needed to complete the tasks, and the contribution and dependency links show the relationships between the different elements in the GRL model.
