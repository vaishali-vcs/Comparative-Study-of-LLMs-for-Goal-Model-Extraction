Actors: 

* Montfort Hospital (system itself)
* Patients (stakeholders)

SoftGoals:

* Provide real-time information of patient status and wait time
* Improve patient experience and satisfaction
* Enhance the efficiency of the hospital's operations

Goals:

* To register patients in the system
* To give patients access codes to track the process
* To set the current status and expected time for each patient

Tasks:

* To register patients in the system
* To give patients access codes to track the process
* To set the current status and expected time for each patient

Resources:

* WTES system
* Access codes
* Nurses

Contribution Links:

* Patient registration and access code assignment contribute to the goal of providing real-time information of patient status and wait time
* Nurse setting the current status and expected time contributes to the goal of improving patient experience and satisfaction

Dependency Links:

* The success of the WTES system depends on the availability of the hospital's resources, such as nurses and access codes

Decomposition Links:

* Patient registration can be decomposed into sub-tasks, such as collecting patient information and verifying patient identity
* Access code assignment can be decomposed into sub-tasks, such as generating access codes and distributing them to patients

Note: The above list of intentional elements is not exhaustive and may change depending on the specific requirements of the project.
