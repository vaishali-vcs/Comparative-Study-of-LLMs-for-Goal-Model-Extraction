Actors:

* Montfort Hospital (the system itself)
* Nurses (stakeholders who will use the system to track the process and provide information to patients)

SoftGoals:

* Provide patients with real-time information of their status and wait time
* Improve patient satisfaction by keeping them informed about the progress of their treatment
* Reduce the time patients spend in the hospital by streamlining the process and reducing wait times

SoftGoals Specifications:

* The system shall be able to track the patient's status in real-time and provide the patient with an estimated wait time for each step of the process
* The system shall be able to update the patient's status and expected wait time in real-time as the process progresses
* The system shall be able to provide patients with real-time notifications of any changes to their status or wait time

Goals:

* To provide nurses with an easy-to-use system to track the patient's process and provide information to patients
* To reduce the time nurses spend on tracking the patient's process and providing information to patients

Tasks:

* To register patients in the system and provide them with an access code to track their process
* To set the current status and expected time for each step of the process
* To update the patient's status and expected wait time in real-time as the process progresses

Resources:

* The system shall be accessible to nurses and patients
* The system shall have a user-friendly interface for nurses to easily track the patient's process and provide information to patients

Contribution Links:

* The system shall contribute to the improvement of patient satisfaction by providing real-time information of their status and wait time
* The system shall contribute to the reduction of time patients spend in the hospital by streamlining the process and reducing wait times

Dependency Links:

* The system shall be dependent on the availability of the hospital's IT infrastructure and network
* The system shall be dependent on the nurses' ability to use the system and track the patient's process

Decomposition Links:

* The system shall be decomposed into the following components: patient registration, access code provision, status and wait time tracking, and real-time notifications

Note: The above list of intentional elements is not exhaustive and may change as new information is gathered or as the requirements of the system evolve.
