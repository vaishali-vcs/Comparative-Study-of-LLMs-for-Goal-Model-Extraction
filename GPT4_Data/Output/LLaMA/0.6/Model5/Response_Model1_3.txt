Actors:

* Montfort Hospital (system itself)
* Patients (stakeholders)

Soft Goals:

* Provide patients with real-time information about their status and wait time
* Improve patient satisfaction by keeping them informed about the progress of their treatment
* Reduce patient anxiety and uncertainty by providing transparent and accurate information about wait times

Goals:

* To provide a system that allows nurses to track the status of patients and estimate wait times
* To enable nurses to set the current status and expected time for each patient

Tasks:

* Develop a user-friendly interface for patients to track their status and wait times
* Implement a system that allows nurses to update the current status and expected time for each patient in real-time
* Ensure the system is integrated with existing hospital systems and processes

Resources:

* Computers and tablets for patients to access the system
* Network connectivity to enable real-time updates
* Nursing staff to update the system with current status and expected time for each patient

Contribution Links:

* Patients can contribute to the system by providing feedback on its usability and effectiveness
* Nurses can contribute to the system by updating the current status and expected time for each patient

Dependencies:

* The system is dependent on the availability of nursing staff to update the current status and expected time for each patient
* The system is dependent on the hospital's existing IT infrastructure and networks

Decomposition Links:

* The system can be decomposed into sub-systems for patient registration, status tracking, and wait time estimation
* The system can be decomposed into individual components for user interface, data storage, and real-time updates

Note: The above list of intentional elements is a starting point and can be further refined and expanded based on the specific requirements of the Wait Time Estimation System.
