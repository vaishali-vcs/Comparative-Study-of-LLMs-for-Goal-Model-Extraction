Actors:

* Traffic engineers
* Traffic planners
* City officials

SoftGoals:

* Improve traffic flow and reduce congestion
* Provide clear visualizations of traffic density and bottlenecks
* Enable efficient road traffic engineering and design

Goals:

* Accurately simulate traffic flow and congestion
* Provide realistic animations of traffic flow and bottlenecks
* Offer a user-friendly interface for traffic engineers and planners

Tasks:

* Develop a simulation model that can accurately represent traffic flow and congestion
* Implement a visualization system that highlights traffic density and bottlenecks
* Create realistic animations of traffic flow and bottlenecks

Resources:

* High-performance computing resources
* Traffic data and sensors
* GIS and mapping software

Contribution Links:

* Traffic engineers can use the simulator to identify bottlenecks and optimize traffic flow
* Traffic planners can use the simulator to evaluate different traffic management strategies
* City officials can use the simulator to make informed decisions about traffic infrastructure and policy

Dependency Links:

* The simulator depends on accurate traffic data and sensors to function effectively
* The visualization system depends on the simulation model to generate accurate traffic density maps
* The animations depend on the simulation model and visualization system to provide realistic traffic flow and bottleneck simulations

Decomposition Links:

* The simulation model can be decomposed into individual traffic scenarios and parameters
* The visualization system can be decomposed into separate components for visualizing traffic density and bottlenecks
* The animations can be decomposed into individual traffic events and animations for different traffic scenarios.
