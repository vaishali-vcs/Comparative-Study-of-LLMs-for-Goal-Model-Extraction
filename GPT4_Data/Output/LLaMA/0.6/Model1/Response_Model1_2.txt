Actors:
- Traffic Simulator (System)

SoftGoals:
- Real-time traffic flow visualization
- Accurate representation of traffic density and congestion
- Detailed animations to identify bottlenecks and improve traffic engineering

Goals:
- Efficient traffic flow simulation
- Improved road traffic engineering and design

Tasks:
- Real-time traffic data analysis
- Visualization of traffic density and congestion using density maps
- Animation of traffic flow and bottlenecks

Resources:
- Real-time traffic data
- Advanced visualization and animation tools

Contribution Links:
- Real-time traffic data contributes to accurate traffic flow simulation
- Visualization and animation tools contribute to clear visualizations and detailed animations

Dependency Links:
- Traffic Simulator depends on real-time traffic data for accurate simulation
- Traffic Simulator depends on advanced visualization and animation tools for clear visualizations and detailed animations

Decomposition Links:
- Traffic flow simulation can be decomposed into real-time data analysis, visualization, and animation
- Real-time traffic data analysis can be decomposed into data collection, data processing, and data visualization

Note: The decomposition links are not explicitly mentioned in the user story, but they can be inferred based on the components of the system and the tasks involved.
