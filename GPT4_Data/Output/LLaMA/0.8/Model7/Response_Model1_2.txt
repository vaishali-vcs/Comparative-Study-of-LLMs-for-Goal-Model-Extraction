Actors:

• Business Owner (system or stakeholder)

Soft Goals:

• Enhance system security to protect against unauthorized access and data breaches.
• Ensure the online shopping experience is secure and trustworthy for customers.

Soft Goals Specifications:

• Implement multi-factor authentication methods, including fingerprint recognition, password entry, and cardkey access.
• Employ end-to-end encryption for all sensitive data transmitted between the system and customers.
• Regularly update and maintain the system's security protocols to stay ahead of emerging threats.
• Ensure system logs are properly stored and monitored to detect and respond to security incidents.

Goals:

• Boost sales by providing an online shopping experience.

Tasks:

• Develop and implement a secure online shopping platform.
• Integrate multi-factor authentication methods.
• Implement end-to-end encryption for sensitive data transmissions.
• Monitor and update system security protocols regularly.
• Ensure system logs are properly stored and monitored.

Resources:

• Development team with expertise in secure coding practices and web application security.
• Infrastructure for hosting the online shopping platform.
• Security audit and testing tools.

Contribution Links:

• The secure online shopping platform will contribute to the achievement of the soft goal of enhancing system security.
• The implementation of multi-factor authentication will contribute to the achievement of the soft goal of protecting against unauthorized access.

Dependency Links:

• The online shopping platform's security will depend on the implementation of multi-factor authentication and end-to-end encryption.
• The success of the online shopping platform will depend on the development team's expertise in secure coding practices and web application security.

Decomposition Links:

• Implementing multi-factor authentication can be decomposed into sub-tasks, such as fingerprint recognition, password entry, and cardkey access.
• Implementing end-to-end encryption can be decomposed into sub-tasks, such as configuring SSL/TLS protocols and implementing encryption for sensitive data transmissions.
