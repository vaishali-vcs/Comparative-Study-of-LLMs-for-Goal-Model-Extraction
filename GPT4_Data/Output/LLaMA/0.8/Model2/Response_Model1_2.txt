Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's the list of intentional elements for the given user stories in the format you requested:

* Actors:
	+ User (representing the stakeholder of the system)
	+ Recycling Bin Management System (representing the system itself)
* SoftGoals:
	+ Provide users with easy access to information on public recycling bins and safe disposal events
	+ Increase the efficiency of recycling and waste disposal in the area
	+ Improve the user experience by providing a map display of recycling centers and safe disposal events
	+ Enhance the system's functionality by allowing users to view the locations of recycling centers on a map
	+ Ensure the system's operation capabilities and constraints, such as speed, security, reliability, and data integrity
* Goals:
	+ Provide users with accurate and up-to-date information on public recycling bins and safe disposal events
	+ Offer users the ability to view maps of recycling centers and safe disposal events
	+ Facilitate the recycling and waste disposal process for users
* Tasks:
	+ Display public recycling bins on a map
	+ Display safe disposal events on a map
	+ Provide users with the ability to filter recycling centers and safe disposal events by distance or location
	+ Ensure the accuracy and up-to-date-ness of the information provided
	+ Offer users the ability to search for specific recycling centers or safe disposal events
* Resources:
	+ Geographic information system (GIS) data
	+ Maps and mapping technology
	+ User interface and user experience design expertise
	+ Database management system
	+ Network and server infrastructure
* Contribution Links:
	+ User story s1: "As a user, I want to be able to view a map display of the public recycling bins around my area."
	+ User story S2: "As a user, I want to be able to view the safe disposal events currently being organised around my area."
	+ User story S3: "As a user, I want to view all locations of recycling centers on a map, so that I can check which routes to take to drop off waste."
* Dependencies links:
	+ User story s1 depends on the availability of GIS data and mapping technology
	+ User story S2 depends on the availability of information on safe disposal events
	+ User story S3 depends on the availability of GIS data and mapping technology, as well as the ability to filter recycling centers and safe disposal events by distance or location
* Decomposition links:
	+ User story s1 can be decomposed into the following sub-tasks:
		- Display public recycling bins on a map
		- Provide users with the ability to filter recycling bins by distance or location
	+ User story S2 can be decomposed into the following sub-tasks:
		- Display safe disposal events on a map
		- Provide users with the ability to filter safe disposal events by distance or location
	+ User story S3 can be decomposed into the following sub-tasks:
		- Display all locations of recycling centers on a map
		- Provide users with the ability to search for specific recycling centers or safe disposal events
