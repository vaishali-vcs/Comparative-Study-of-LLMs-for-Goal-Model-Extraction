Actors:

* Patients
* Nurses

SoftGoals:

* Provide real-time information about the patient's status and wait time
* Improve patient satisfaction by keeping them informed about the process
* Reduce patient frustration by providing accurate wait time estimates

Goals:

* To inform patients about the current status of the process
* To provide accurate wait time estimates to patients
* To improve patient satisfaction and reduce patient frustration

Tasks:

* Register patients in the system
* Give patients access codes to track the process in the system
* Set current status and expected time for each step

Resources:

* Patient registration database
* Access code database
* Real-time wait time estimation system

Contribution Links:

* Patient registration information contributes to the accuracy of wait time estimates
* Access code information contributes to the patient's ability to track the process
* Current status and expected time information contributes to the real-time wait time estimates

Dependency Links:

* The system depends on the patient registration database to store patient information
* The system depends on the access code database to store access code information
* The system depends on the real-time wait time estimation system to provide accurate wait time estimates

Decomposition Links:

* Patient registration can be decomposed into sub-tasks such as collecting patient information, verifying patient information, and storing patient information in the database
* Access code can be decomposed into sub-tasks such as generating access codes, distributing access codes to patients, and verifying access codes

Note: The above list of intentional elements is not exhaustive and can be further expanded or modified based on the specific requirements of the system.
