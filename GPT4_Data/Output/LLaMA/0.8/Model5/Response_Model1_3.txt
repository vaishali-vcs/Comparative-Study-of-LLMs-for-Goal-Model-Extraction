Actors: Montfort Hospital (system itself), patients, nurses
SoftGoals: 

* Provide patients with real-time information about their status and wait time
* Reduce uncertainty and anxiety for patients
* Increase transparency and communication between patients, nurses, and other hospital staff

Goals:

* To register patients in the system
* To give patients an access code to track the process
* To set the current status and expected time for each patient

Tasks:

* To develop a user-friendly interface for patients to track their status and wait time
* To integrate the system with the hospital's existing systems (e.g. electronic medical records)
* To ensure the system is secure and confidential

Resources:

* Hospital IT infrastructure (servers, networks, databases)
* Software development team
* Security experts

Contribution Links:

* Patients can contribute to the system by providing feedback on the user experience and suggestions for improvement
* Nurses can contribute to the system by updating the current status and expected time for each patient
* Hospital IT infrastructure is essential for the system to function properly

Dependencies Links:

* The system depends on the hospital's existing systems (e.g. electronic medical records) to gather information about the patients' status and wait time
* The system depends on the nurses to update the current status and expected time for each patient

Decomposition Links:

* The system can be decomposed into sub-systems for patient registration, access code generation, and status and wait time tracking
* The system can be decomposed into smaller components for user interface, data integration, and security

Note: The above list of intentional elements is not exhaustive and can be expanded or modified as needed based on the specific requirements of the system.
