* Reduce patient anxiety by providing accurate wait time estimates.
* Increase patient satisfaction by keeping them informed about the progress of their treatment.

Goals:

* To provide patients with real-time information about their current status in the process.
* To estimate wait times for patients at each step of the process.

Tasks:

* Register patients in the WTES system.
* Provide nurses with access codes to track the process in the system.
* Set the current status and expected time for each step of the process.

Resources:

* WTES system
* Access codes
* Nursing staff

Contribution Links:

* Patient registration in WTES system contributes to the goal of providing real-time information to patients.
* Setting the current status and expected time for each step of the process contributes to the goal of estimating wait times.

Dependency Links:

* The success of the WTES system depends on the availability of the nursing staff to set the current status and expected time for each step of the process.

Decomposition Links:

* Patient registration can be decomposed into sub-tasks such as entering patient information, verifying patient identity, and confirming patient registration.
* Setting the current status and expected time for each step of the process can be decomposed into sub-tasks such as identifying the current step, estimating the time required for the step, and updating the system with the current status and expected time.
