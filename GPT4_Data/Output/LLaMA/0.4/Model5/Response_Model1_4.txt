Actors: 

* Montfort Hospital (system)
* Patients (stakeholders)

SoftGoals:

* Provide patients with real-time information about their status and wait time
* Improve patient satisfaction by keeping them informed about the process
* Reduce patient anxiety and uncertainty by providing clear and accurate information
* Increase efficiency of the process by reducing the need for patients to ask staff for updates

Goals:

* To provide patients with accurate and up-to-date information about their status and wait time
* To enable nurses to easily set and update the current status and expected time for each patient
* To improve the overall patient experience and satisfaction with the process

Tasks:

* Develop a user-friendly interface for patients to track their status and wait time
* Implement a system for nurses to set and update the current status and expected time for each patient
* Integrate the system with existing hospital systems to ensure accurate and up-to-date information

Resources:

* Hospital IT infrastructure
* Development team
* Software and hardware for the system

Contribution Links:

* Patients can contribute to the system by providing feedback and suggestions for improvement
* Nurses can contribute to the system by providing accurate and up-to-date information about the patient's status and expected time

Dependencies Links:

* The system depends on the availability of hospital IT infrastructure and the development team
* The system depends on the accuracy and completeness of the information provided by nurses

Decomposition Links:

* The system can be decomposed into smaller components, such as the user interface, the database, and the integration with existing hospital systems

Note: The softgoals and goals are not mutually exclusive, and the tasks and resources are not exhaustive, but rather a starting point for the development of the Wait Time Estimation System.
