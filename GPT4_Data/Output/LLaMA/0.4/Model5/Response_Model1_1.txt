Actors:

* Montfort Hospital (the system itself)
* Patients (stakeholders)

SoftGoals:

* Provide patients with real-time information of their status and wait time
* Improve patient experience and satisfaction
* Increase transparency and trust in the system

Goals:

* To provide accurate and up-to-date information about the patient's status and wait time
* To enable nurses to easily set the current status and expected time

Tasks:

* To register patients in the system
* To give patients an access code to track the process in the system
* To set the current status and expected time

Resources:

* The system itself (WTES)
* Nurses and other hospital staff

Contribution Links:

* The system will contribute to improving patient experience and satisfaction
* The system will contribute to increasing transparency and trust in the system

Dependencies Links:

* The system depends on the nurses and other hospital staff to set the current status and expected time

Decomposition Links:

* The task of registering patients can be decomposed into sub-tasks such as collecting patient information, verifying patient identity, and creating a patient account
* The task of setting the current status and expected time can be decomposed into sub-tasks such as updating the patient's information, setting the current status, and estimating the expected time
