Certainly, here is a breakdown of the elements in the user story: 

- Actors - The main actors in this story are the kids who will seek counseling and the counselors providing the service. There are also peripheral actors such as the organization itself and potentially the technical team responsible for choosing and implementing the technical options for the internet counseling service. 

- SoftGoals - 

1. Confidentiality - The organization needs to ensure that any information shared during online counseling sessions is kept private and confidential. The system should have robust security measures to protect the privacy of both the kids and the counselors. 

2. Accessibility - The system should be easy to use and accessible to kids who may have varying levels of technical proficiency. It should also allow counselors to respond efficiently and effectively to a large number of kids seeking help, ideally simultaneously. 

3. Accountability - The system should keep track of the advice given and maintain a record of conversations to protect the organization from liability in case of any misinterpretation or dispute. 

4. Scalability - As the organization aims to expand their services, the system should be able to handle increased traffic and growing demand without sacrificing performance or security. 

5. Integration - The system should be capable of integrating with other relevant services or systems, such as existing anonymous question-and-answer platforms, to provide a seamless user experience. 

6. User Tracking - The system should have mechanisms to identify and flag troubled kids who need urgent care based on their online activities, without compromising their anonymity. 

7. Data Integrity - The system should ensure that data is accurate, consistent, and trustworthy, and that it adheres to relevant data protection regulations. 

8. Predictive Analytics - The system could leverage data analytics to identify trends and patterns in counseling sessions, which can help counselors improve their services and assist kids more effectively. 

9. Feedback Collection - The system could have built-in mechanisms to collect feedback from kids and counselors, which can be used for continuous improvement and quality assurance. 

10. Cost-effectiveness - The organization is not-for-profit and therefore might have budget constraints. Thus, the system should ideally be cost-effective, both in terms of initial implementation and ongoing maintenance. 

- Goals - The main goal is to expand their ability to provide counseling to kids via the Internet while maintaining (and ideally improving upon) the levels of confidentiality, accountability, and effectiveness that they offer through their existing counseling services. 

- Tasks - The organization needs to choose the most suitable technical option from the list provided, implement the chosen option, ensure it complies with legal and ethical obligations, and train their counselors to use the new system. 

- Resources - The resources required might include financial resources to develop or adapt the chosen technical option, human resources to implement and maintain the system, and resources to train the counselors. 

- Contribution Links - The links here might indicate how the choices of technical options and their implementation might contribute to achieving the goals set out. For example, choosing a secure and anonymous chat platform could contribute to the goal of maintaining confidentiality, while choosing an integrated system that works well with the existing infrastructure could contribute to the goal of scalability. 

- Dependencies Links - These might refer to tasks or conditions that must be completed before the organization can begin expanding their internet counseling service. For example, they may require preliminary research to choose among the options of technical options, budgetary approval, or legal review to ensure compliance with privacy laws. 

- Decomposition Links - These would indicate how the user story can be broken down into smaller, more manageable tasks. For example, the organization might need to define criteria for choosing a technical option, create a shortlist of options that meet those criteria, and then evaluate each option in greater detail to make a final decision.
