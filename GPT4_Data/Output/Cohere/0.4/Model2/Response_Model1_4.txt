#### Additional Notes ####
The actors in each story are the users of the system. The soft goals are specifications that detail how the system operates and provides functionality to the user. The goals are what the user wants to achieve with the system. The tasks are the steps the user will take to use the system and achieve their goals. The resources are what the user will need to complete their tasks. The contribution and dependency links are not mentioned in the provided user stories, so they have been left blank. The decomposition links are also not mentioned in the user stories, so they have also been left blank. 

Would you like me to restructure this list in a different way?
