## Actors: Traffic engineers, planners and designers
## SoftGoals: Efficient road traffic engineering and design, minimized congestion and optimized traffic flow
## Goals: To analyze and find optimal solutions for road traffic
## Tasks: To simulate changes, additions or subtractions in a road network, generate statistics for congestion and traffic jams, optimize traffic light timing and sequencing and assess the impact of public objects and buildings on road networks
## Resources: Road traffic simulation software such as AnyLogic or Traffix, traffic lights, road network objects (e.g. parking bays, bus stops, access lanes)
## Contribution links: The placement of road network objects and optimization of traffic light sequencing directly influence traffic flow and capacity
## Dependencies links: None
## Decomposition links: None
