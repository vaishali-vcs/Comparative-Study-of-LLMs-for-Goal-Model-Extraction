## Actors: Traffic engineers, planners and designers
## SoftGoals: Efficient road traffic engineering and design, minimize congestion and traffic jams, optimize road networks
## Goals: Achieve efficient road traffic
## Tasks: 
- Use road traffic simulation software like AnyLogic to perform analysis, generate statistics and find optimal solutions for traffic flow and capacity
- Plan road networks, sequencing and timing of traffic lights and placement of road objects to influence traffic flow
- Conduct traffic impact assessments
## Resources: Traffic simulation software, road network data
## Contribution links: Engineers use software to model and optimize road traffic which aids development through clear visualizations of congestion
## Dependencies links: Road networks and traffic are dependent on the sequencing and timing of traffic lights
## Decomposition links: None
