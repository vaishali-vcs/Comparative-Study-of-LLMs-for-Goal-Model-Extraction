Certainly, here is a breakdown of the intentional elements in the user story:

- Actors: Wireless Telephony Company, Telephony Engineers

- SoftGoals:
  - High network performance (High throughput, low latency, and minimal dropped calls or signal loss)
  - Low infrastructure cost (Minimal hardware changes and utilization of existing infrastructure)
  - Ensuring safety and security of data and transmissions
  - Adaptable to a variety of different geographic locations and environmental conditions

- Goals: To optimize their infrastructure to achieve maximum performance while minimizing costs and resource expenditures.

- Tasks:
  - Survey existing infrastructure and performance metrics
  - Identify areas of the network that could be optimized to improve performance
  - Test and trial different hardware and software to identify areas of improvement
  - Design an infrastructure layout that minimizes hardware alterations while maintaining desired performance outcomes
  - Install and monitor new infrastructure

- Resources: Financial resources to purchase new hardware and software, human resources to design and implement infrastructure changes, and access to relevant data and analytics to measure performance.

- Contribution links: Improving hardware utilization may result in cost savings that can be reinvested into other areas of the business to drive growth. Increasing network performance may result in more customers subscribing to the wireless service, increasing revenue.

- Dependencies links: This project may depend on the completion of previous network infrastructure upgrades, or delays in obtaining necessary permits for infrastructure changes.

- Decomposition links: This goal can be further broken down into smaller tasks, such as researching and identifying specific areas of the network that require optimization, or sourcing and pricing different hardware options.
