Certainly, here is a list of the intentional elements in the user story: 

- Actors: This could include the children seeking counseling services, the counselors providing these services, and potentially the managers or administrators of the counseling system.
- SoftGoals: 
  - Specifications: The system should support a certain number of simultaneous connections to ensure that multiple children can receive assistance. It should also have mechanisms in place to protect the privacy and confidentiality of conversations, given the sensitive nature of the interactions. Additionally, the system should aim for minimal latency in communication to facilitate real-time conversations.
  - Preventing counselor burnout: The system should have mechanisms to monitor counselor workload, and potentially flag or redirect conversations to other counselors if a counselor is approaching their capacity. This could be achieved through workload balancing algorithms. 
  - Job satisfaction: The system should have tools to support counselors in their work, such as progress tracking and note-taking features, as well as potentially a feedback system to encourage and recognize counselors who go above and beyond. 

- Goals: The goal of the counseling service is to provide assistance to children and to actively listen to their needs, while also striving to prevent counselor burnout and promote job satisfaction.

- Tasks: 
  - Counsellors need to listen to children's concerns, provide emotional support, and assist them in finding appropriate solutions or coping mechanisms.
  - They might also need to escalate particularly serious cases to authorities or additional support systems. 
  - Administrators need to ensure the smooth operation of the system, including overseeing counselor workloads and maintaining the security and privacy of the platform. 

- Resources: This could include the technological resources of the cyber cafes and portal chat rooms, as well as potentially the resources available to counselors to assist children, such as reference materials or training courses. 

- Contribution links: The story implies that children and counselors both contribute to the goal of providing assistance to children. 

- Dependencies links: The smooth operation of the system depends on both counselors being available and alert, and the technological resources functioning properly. 

- Decomposition links: The tasks of listening to children and providing support could be broken down into further sub-tasks, such as active listening techniques and response strategies.
