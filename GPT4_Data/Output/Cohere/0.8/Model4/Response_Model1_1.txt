2. **Specify Stakeholder Needs**: Clarify the specific needs or objectives of each stakeholder group (e.g., executives, HR employees, general employees) in accessing the data. This can help identify their individual requirements and goals.

3. **Include Success Criteria**: Define what constitutes successful completion for each user story. This could include metrics like error rate, response time, or user satisfaction metrics.

4. **Expand on Tasks**: Provide more detail on the specific tasks that stakeholders need to perform, especially for user stories involving data modification.

5. **Identify Potential Risks**: Identify potential risks or challenges associated with fulfilling these user stories, such as data privacy concerns, system performance issues, or access rights.
