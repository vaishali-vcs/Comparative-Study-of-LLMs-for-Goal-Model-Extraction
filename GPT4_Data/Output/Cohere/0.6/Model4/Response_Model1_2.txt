### Additional Information:
If you're looking for more information to supplement these user stories, consider the following:

- The specific data points the executives, HR employees, and other employees are allowed to view and modify. This could include sales numbers, customer data, employee information, etc.
- The time frame of the data (e.g. real-time, weekly, monthly).
- The consequences of different employees having access to this information. 

This information could help shape the SoftGoals and Goals for each story, as well as the Actors' Tasks.
