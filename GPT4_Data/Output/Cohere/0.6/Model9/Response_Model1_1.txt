Sounds like a very interesting challenge! 

Here is a breakdown of the elements in the user story: 

- **Actors**: This could be the children seeking counseling services, the counselors providing these services, and potentially the system itself (if there is one). 

- **SoftGoals**: Specifications for the smooth operation of the system could include: robustness of the platform (to handle large number of users), security and privacy measures to protect sensitive user information, mechanisms for counselor support and supervision to prevent burnout, and user-friendly interfaces for both children and counselors to encourage engagement. 

- **Goals**: The goal is to provide effective online counseling services while preventing counselor burnout and promoting job satisfaction. There may also be a goal of collecting feedback to improve these services. 

- **Tasks**: The tasks could include scheduling and hosting cyber cafes and portal chat rooms, training counselors to provide support, implementing security protocols, collecting and analyzing feedback, and optimizing counselor workload to prevent burnout. 

- **Resources**: The resources could include the technological infrastructure for the online services, a pool of trained counselors, policies and protocols for counselor support, and potentially budget for marketing and outreach to reach children in need of services. 

- **Contribution links**: The links could indicate how providing online counseling services contributes to the larger goal of supporting children in need. 

- **Dependencies links**: The dependencies could highlight the importance of reliable technological infrastructure and adequate counselor training to ensure the effective operation of the services. 

- **Decomposition links**: Decomposition links could indicate how the above tasks and sub-tasks relate to each other in order to achieve the overall goal. 

It's important to note that it's challenging to provide a comprehensive list of elements without more context or details about the specific system or scenario in question. If you provide more information, I can help you further break down these elements.
